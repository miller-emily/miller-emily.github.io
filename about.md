  Emily Miller is a first-year MA student at Northeastern University. She is interested in the way that novels portray times of great change--environmental, technological, social--which rose out of a great love of Victorian, contemporary, and science fiction novels. She is not published anywhere, nor has she done anything of note just yet. She received her BA in English from UMass Amherst in 2020.
